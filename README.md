# taiwanesedictionary
Taiwanese Dictionary for iOS

I just pushed the repository to GitHub. I think it is working.

I haven't touched this since 2014. Half the code is deprecated and I had to fiddle with some settings to get it to compile again. I don't really know how to use source control, but I had set up a local git repository when I was working on this in 2014 so I can still see older commit messages.

I used ParseKit (which is/was a Pod) probably for regular expressions (?) - something about the Pod setup means we have to open the project by opening 'Taiwanese.xcworkspace', otherwise something breaks. I'm sure there is a better way to do this now.
